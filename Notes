Work on using nested dictionaries in another file to read and analyze each individual coin
    Then we can math some stuff up
    Use lots of text formatting
    Make a clean-ish ASCII UI 
    Present cool information    (Maybe write a script to graph in google sheets/excel)
    Minds. *kaboom* Blown.


Possibly store data in this format
Dict = {
Coin : Dict{
    Date: [List of datetime (in order)]
    Dollar: [List of dollar amounts (in order)]
},
Coin : Dict,
}

Then we can compare the change in price over a time period

Or we can do it like this

Dict = {
    Coin : [Date: Dollar,]
}


####
Could make the inputs more customizable.
User input dictates the time period the data is analyzed from. Or picks the frequency of requests
