Work on using nested dictionaries in another file to read and analyze each individual coin
    Then we can math some stuff up
    Use lots of text formatting
    Make a clean-ish ASCII UI 
    Present cool information    (Maybe write a script to graph in google sheets/excel)
    Minds. *kaboom* Blown.


Possibly store data in this format
Dict = {
Coin : Dict{
    Date: [List of datetime (in order)]
    Dollar: [List of dollar amounts (in order)]
},
Coin : Dict,
}

Then we can compare the change in price over a time period

Or we can do it like this

Dict = {
    Coin : [Date: Dollar,]
}

Could make the inputs more customizable.
User input dictates the time period the data is analyzed from. Or picks the frequency of requests




Dict = {
    Key : Value,
    Key : Value,
}

Note to self: We are stupid
Spent the last hour on a plane dealing with recursion errors in all_parts.py and realized that one small for loop and no recursion does the same thing and is way smaller

The error was once it finished we got stuck in an infinite loop do to the layers of recursion


## Finished setting up the main file
    Details:
        Scrapes crypto website
        Asks user for two inputs
            1. Time between requests (Seconds)
            2. Amount of requests
        Cycles through until completion
        Uploads all data to a csv file
        Organizes data into Dict : List format
        

## 12/24/21
    Created dict_file_analyzer.py to read the list data and return basic information about it
    Returns and prints:
        -Average
        -Max
        -Min
        -Percent Change
    Next plans are to fully integrate it into the Main.py and eventually have a fully operational program that works all on its own. 
    Hopefully finish before stepping aside for a little and learning Java
